This is rough sketch of what programming Azulogico might look like.

The assembler should use "Example.azh" as an indexto tell all the states in the "Example" state machine. That's the "header" files, thus the "azh" extension, for "azulogico header".
"stt" files define the enter, exit and combinatory rules.
"azr" is for "azulogico routines" and defines arbitrary routines which would be referred in the header.
